      type: object
      description: |
        Sent to the server to retrieve the items that are on a specified list of locations. 
        The server will respond with a LocationInfo packet containing the items located in the
        scouted locations. Fully remote clients without a patch file may use this to 
        "place" items onto their in-game locations, most commonly to display their 
        names or item classifications before/upon pickup.

        LocationScouts can also be used to inform the server of 
        locations the client has seen, but not checked. 
        This creates a hint as if the player had run !hint_location on a location, 
        but without deducting hint points. This is useful in cases where an item appears 
        in the game world, such as 'ledge items' in A Link to the Past. 
        To do this, set the create_as_hint parameter to a non-zero value.
